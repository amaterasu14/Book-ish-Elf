This is my first attempt at creating a functional website using the E-Commerce model of a bookstore: The Book-ish Elf.

For this project I used python language in adition to some django features, but this endeavor also cost me several hours staring at JS and CSS documentation, among others.

The website allows the user to register an account, storing his info inside the database, displays functional features for adding, deleting and updating the basket with products.

In the sequence of actions is also possible for the user to see his orders saved in the event of not finalizing his purchase.

It is possible to finalize the order by typing billing informations, such as address, credit card number, as well.

I made this project with the purpose of studying but also as a way of proving myself that it is never too late to change directions and pursue what you really like doing.
